# Text Gravity

This is a simple web app that allows users to enter text, which will then be drawn on an HTML canvas with a falling gravity effect. The text can also include a special keyword 'ball' to draw a ball shape on the canvas.

# Ideas for improvement

- Draw a ball shape on the canvas when the user enters the keyword 'ball' in the text input.
- Add a border around the text, simulate a messaging app.
- Add a color picker to allow users to change the color of the text and ball.
- Add a slider to allow users to change the gravity effect.
- Add a slider to allow users to change the font size of the text.
